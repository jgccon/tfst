## Bounded Contexts

- [Talent Hiring & Contracts](talent_hiring_contracts.md)
- [Payments & Billing](payments_billing.md)
- [Organizations & Team Management](organizations_team_management.md)

## Next Steps
- Define permissions and role management.
- Refine AI-based talent matching.
- Expand the hiring and payment workflows.
