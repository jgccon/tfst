# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This includes, but is not limited to, people of all ages, body sizes, disabilities, ethnicities, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, and sexual orientations.

## Our Standards

To create a positive environment, we expect the following behaviors:

- **Use welcoming language**.
- **Respect differing viewpoints and experiences**.
- **Accept constructive criticism gracefully**.
- **Focus on what is best for the community**.
- **Demonstrate empathy towards fellow community members**.

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- The use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, or any form of intimidation.
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., physical or electronic addresses) without explicit permission.
- Any other behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. This includes removing, editing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [juan@jgcarmona.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4.
