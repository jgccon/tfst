# 4. Solution Strategy

## Architectural Approach
- **Multitenancy**: Implemented at the database level to support multiple clients with isolated data.
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment.
- **Secrets Management**: Use Azure Key Vault to store sensitive information.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for consistent development and deployment environments.
