# 11. Risks and Technical Debt

## Potential Risks
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Risk of data leakage across tenants.
- **Cloud Vendor Lock-In**: Heavy reliance on Azure could limit future portability.

## Technical Debt
- **Scaling Multitenant Solution**: Potential need for database optimization as the number of tenants grows.
- **API Rate Limits**: Consider rate limiting and caching mechanisms to handle high traffic.
