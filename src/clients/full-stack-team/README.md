# Full-Stack Team – Landing Site (`full-stack.team`)

Welcome to the **official landing website** of [The Full-Stack Team (TFST)](https://tfst.dev) — an open-source, decentralized platform designed to empower professionals, freelancers, recruiters, and companies through smart contracts, AI, and transparent collaboration.

This site is the **primary marketing and engagement hub** for the project. It is designed as a **funnel** to attract contributors, showcase features, and convert interest into real participation — whether you're a developer, a recruiter, or a project owner.
