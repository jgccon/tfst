# The Full-Stack Team Infrastructure

## Introduction
This repository contains the main infrastructure project for **The Full-Stack Team** application, built with Terraform and Terragrunt. The Terraform configurations are organized into reusable modules, while Terragrunt keeps the environment-specific configurations DRY.

## Security and Best Practices
Since this is a public repository, follow these guidelines to ensure security:
1. **Sensitive Data**: Store all sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, and secrets, in [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) and not directly in the files.
2. **Terraform State**: Terraform state files are stored in an Azure Storage Account to prevent accidental uploads. Make sure that `terraform.tfstate` is ignored in `.gitignore`.
3. **Environment Variables**: Set up environment variables for local testing instead of storing secrets directly in configuration files.

## Terraform & Terragrunt
All Terraform modules are located in the `_modules_` directory. We use [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) to manage configurations per environment and to handle state backends and variables consistently.

Run Terragrunt commands instead of Terraform. For example:
- Instead of `terraform plan`, use `terragrunt plan`
- Instead of `terraform apply`, use `terragrunt apply`

## Setting Up Azure Backend for State Management
For each environment, a separate Azure Storage Account is set up to store Terraform state remotely. Ensure that backend configurations are consistent across environments.

### Azure Backend Initialization Script
Use the `initialize_azure_backend.sh` script to set up backend storage:

```bash
bash scripts/initialize_azure_backend.sh <your-azure-subscription-id>
```

This script creates:

- An Azure resource group for backend storage
- A storage account and blob container for Terraform state files

The script automatically applies settings that match the backend configurations specified in terragrunt.hcl.

### Backend Configuration Example
In `envs/terragrunt.hcl`, ensure backend configuration matches the storage resources created above:

```hcl
remote_state {
  backend = "azurerm"
  config = {
    resource_group_name  = "tfst-tfstate-dev"
    storage_account_name = "tfstdevstate"
    container_name       = "tfstate-container"
    key                  = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

## Environment Structure
Each environment has its own configuration folder in `envs/` (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`). Each environment uses Terragrunt to handle environment-specific variables and module dependencies.

### Example for `dev` Environment
- Folder structure:
  ```plaintext
  infrastructure/
  ├── envs/
  │   └── dev/
  │       ├── core/
  │       │   └── terragrunt.hcl
  │       └── storage/
  │           └── terragrunt.hcl
  ```
- `terragrunt.hcl` files reference modules and set up environment-specific variables.

## Environment Setup Scripts

We have included helper scripts to simplify the setup process for local development and Azure backend initialization. These scripts ensure that your local environment is properly configured and ready for using Terraform and Terragrunt.

### 1. Azure Backend Initialization (`initialize_azure_backend.sh`)
This script sets up the Azure resources needed to store Terraform state files securely. It creates a dedicated resource group, storage account, and blob container for your Terraform state.

#### Usage:
```bash
bash scripts/initialize_azure_backend.sh <your-azure-subscription-id> <environment>
```

#### Parameters:

<your-azure-subscription-id>: The Azure subscription where the resources will be created.
<environment>: The environment (e.g., dev, prod) for which to set up the backend.

What it does:

Creates an Azure resource group for backend storage.
Creates a storage account and blob container to store your Terraform state files.

This script should be run once during the initial setup for each environment.

### 2. Local Environment Configuration (setup_local_env.sh)
For local development, you can use this script to set up the necessary environment variables for Terraform and Terragrunt. It automatically uses your currently active Azure subscription, so there's no need to manually specify it.

Usage:
```bash
source scripts/setup_local_env.sh
```

#### What it does:
Checks if you're logged into Azure and prompts you to log in if necessary.

Automatically sets the `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, and other environment variables needed by Terraform.

Ensures that the configuration is using the currently active Azure subscription.

By running this script, you can seamlessly switch between environments and work locally without hardcoding sensitive information into your configuration files.

## Running Terragrunt Locally
To apply changes locally, navigate to the environment folder (e.g., `envs/dev/storage`) and use `terragrunt plan` or `terragrunt apply` as follows:

```bash
cd envs/dev/storage
terragrunt plan -out tfst.tfplan
terragrunt apply tfst.tfplan
```

## Module Dependencies
Use Terragrunt to visualize dependencies within an environment. Install [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) and run:

```bash
cd envs/dev
terragrunt graph-dependencies | dot -Tpng > dependencies.png
```

## FAQs
### Error: State Lock
If you encounter a lock error, check if a pipeline was interrupted or another user has the lock. Use the following command to inspect the lock:

```bash
az storage blob show --container-name tfstate-container --name dev/core/terraform.tfstate --account-name tfstdevstate | jq '.properties.lease'
```

To force unlock, use:

```bash
terragrunt force-unlock <lock-id>
```

### Error: Resource Already Exists
This error can occur if a resource was created manually or outside of Terraform. Use `terragrunt import` to import the existing resource:

```bash
terragrunt import <resource> <resource-id>
```
