# 📚 TFST Documentation Has Moved

All official documentation for **The Full-Stack Team** project is now hosted at:

👉 [https://tfst.dev](https://tfst.dev)

---

## Why the Change?

To offer a better experience for developers, contributors, and integrators, we’ve migrated all docs into a modern, styled, and searchable portal built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

This includes:

- 💡 **Architecture** (arc42-based)
- 🔐 **Authentication (OpenIddict)**
- 👤 **ESCO-based professional profiles**
- 🧱 **Domain model and feature guides**
- 🔌 **API references and integration docs**
- 🌍 **Multilingual support**

---

## Contributing to the Docs

All documentation is now maintained under:

```bash
src/clients/tfst-dev/docs/
```

To contribute, edit the relevant `.md` files inside that directory. Then run the portal locally:

```bash
cd src/clients/tfst-dev
npm install
npm run start
```

Your changes will be reflected at `http://localhost:3000`.
